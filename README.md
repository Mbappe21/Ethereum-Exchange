## Ethereum-Exchange using the Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm

This project allows you to get 3 public addresses with their private keys and some ETH. You will be able to send ETH across each address with the right private key, which will create a digital signature to verify each transaction.

1. Install all modules listed on the package.json file:
`npm install`

2. Start the server:
`node server/index.js`

3. Hit command + T to open a new Terminal window

4. Start the Web Application :
`npx parcel client/index.html`

5. Use one of the address and its private key provided in the first Terminal
    window and input an amount to send.

You should see a change in the balance!

Check the first Terminal window for more details.
